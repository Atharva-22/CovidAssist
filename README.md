# CovidAssist
## Description
The basic idea is to take the state and district where patient wants a bed, as input from user. Then the list of all the available beds at that location will be displayed.
This website aims to be self-driven, as the hospitals will enter their data through their account, which will be updated into the list.
Apart from that, COVID-19 tracker and COVID-19 guidelines sections are also accessible.
